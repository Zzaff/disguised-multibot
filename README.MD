This multi-tool is a project I update not that often, if a bug is reported i will jump to it, if a suggestion is posted, i will jump to it when-possible, make sure to join our [discord!](https://discord.gg/5ZuPsbJCKb)

More Features will be added, you can suggest in the discord too.

### Current Features ###
```
can be found in the RELEASES section!
```

### Price ###
There's no price, Its free and will probably be in-development for awhile.

### Source ###
We sadly aren't releasing any source, there will be .py files but obfuscated, also .exe files but you probably trust .py more.

### Information ###
Proxy Checker scrapes proxies, checks them, dumps them in a txt.

I felt the need to keep Proxy Scraper for some reason, suggestions and bugs can be posted in the Issues section.
### Contributors ###
